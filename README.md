Abstract: 
The best neighborhood in our humble opinion is ____. Our metric for choosing the best neighborhood was one which had the most hopsitable place for housing. We chose these three datasets because they are the typical criteria used when searching for a home. First off, the median house price within a neighborhood would be a clear indicator of the average income and wealth of its residents. Next, the amount of jobs would reveal the liklihood of attaining employment in a specific area. Lastly, the crime per capita would demonstrate whether or not a neighborhood is safe and secure.
